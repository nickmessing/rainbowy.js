#*rainbow.js*


rainbow.js is a small library that can do big things.

It creates and manages a color gradient between some specified colors (minimum 2).

The fun part is that you can change not only the position of the color checkpoints, you can also change the type of transition from liniar to any type you want (quadratic and cubic bezier curves are advised).
